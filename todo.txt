TODO:
1) Ingesting multiple experiments at once can kill the machine with threads - probably make the number of threads configurable, and make sure that each import task is run in serial.
2) search for more reusable components
3) All data analysis should probably be done in a web worker - what I truly mean here is to take experiment analysis offline sooner.
4) Add styling around various control entities (buttons, dropdowns, labels)
5) Run a linter
6) total number of reads for each item in the vizualizer
7) remote data set (password, file download)

Possible Future TODO:
1) Create a server that can do the same feature extraction. DELAYED - will revisit with clustering
2) Clustering
3) Maybe Java installed version?
5) Prefix query on gene selectors
6) Clicking back and forth navigation
7) More information while loading (which data set we're on, which stage we're on)

General validation:
- when importing an experiment, make sure it's gene table matches our control
- when importing a tsv, throw useful errors
- when importing an igv, throw useful error
- when loading, disable tab switching
