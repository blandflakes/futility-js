Immediate TODO:
6) remote data set (password, file download)

TODO:
1) search for more reusable components
2) May be able to pass less data to experiment analysis
3) Add styling around various control entities (buttons, dropdowns, labels)
4) Run a linter
5) total number of reads for each item in the vizualizer

Possible Future TODO:
2) Clustering
5) Prefix query on gene selectors
6) Clicking back and forth navigation
7) More information while loading (which data set we're on, which stage we're on)

General validation:
- when importing an experiment, make sure it's gene table matches our control
- when importing a tsv, throw useful errors
- when importing an igv, throw useful error
- when loading, disable tab switching
