Immediate TODO:
1) search for more reusable components
3) Ingesting multiple experiments at once can kill the machine with threads
4) All data analysis should probably be done in a web worker - what I truly mean here is to take experiment analysis offline sooner.
1) Add styling around various control entities (buttons, dropdowns, labels)
1) Better loading messages?
datum is singular, data is plural. Fix this everywhere.
total number of reads for each item in the vizualizer
add index
remote data set (password, file download)
test removing data sets
linter
modified ratio can be NaN

Future TODO:
1) Create a server that can do the same feature extraction. DELAYED - will revisit with clustering
2) Clustering
3) Maybe Java installed version?
4) Local storage of loaded data sets
  * cache via a version and a checksum
5) Prefix query on gene selectors
6) Clicking back and forth navigation

General validation:
- when importing an experiment, make sure it's gene table matches our control
- when importing a tsv, throw useful errors
- when importing an igv, throw useful error
- when loading, disable tab switching
